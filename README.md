# Haptic Belt: Immersive VR Environment for Haptic Feedback Testing  

## Overview  
This project presents a virtual reality (VR) environment designed to test a wearable haptic belt. In VR, tactile sensory feedback is often underrepresented, so this system was developed to explore more natural and realistic touch feedback.  

## Features  
- **Immersive Environment**: Built in Unity (2022.3.56f1) and deployed on Meta Quest 3 (standalone).  
- **Task Design**: Includes an obstacle navigation challenge and a timed *catch-the-sphere* task.  
- **User Study Focused**: Tasks were designed to (a) direct attention away from obstacles, and (b) add time-based stress to participants.  
- **Iterative Development**: Multiple versions of the game were tested before finalizing for experiments.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Engine**: Unity 2022.3.56f1  
- **Hardware**: Meta Quest 3 (Standalone mode), custom-built haptic belt with 6 actuators  
- **Focus**: VR environment + haptic feedback integration
